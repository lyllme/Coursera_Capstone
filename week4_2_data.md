title: Covid19-Number of new patients estimation
# Data
## Data set
The target of this research is to expect a theoretical number of infected persons.Data that might contribute to determining the number of new patients of coronavirus per day include reported cases per day per country and fatalities per day per country. This is a time-series data set, starting from January 21st, 2020. I will use foursquare to acquire locational data to visualize the intercountry difference.

## Nessesity of this research
At the initial phase in spreading, there is enough supply of test kits to inspect people who want to, 
However, in the later phase, they are distributed to those who have a high possibility of positivity, the government cannot always grasp the actual number of infected people anymore.
I have a strong interest in Japan, where there are not enough test kits as Korea and Singapore. 

As of April 31st, the Japanese government recognizes 14088 cases and 415 Fatalities, which is not as large as Italy and France.
Tn order to estimate the number of potential cases in Japan, I  examine the trend of Italy and the US where the largest number of cases reported as of today and compare the gap between Japan and these two countries.
